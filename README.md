## Invistigate the No-show appointments Dataset <br>
In this project, I analyze a dataset and communicate my findings of it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to do the analysis.

## Dataset
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row such as:

1. ScheduledDay: tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.<br>
2. Neighborhood: indicates the location of the hospital.<br>
3. Scholarship: indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welf program.<br>
4. No-show: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.


## Run
To run this project you'll need a Python 3 version
